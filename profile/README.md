# Get Involved
Tagion is a fully decentralised data- and transaction system, meaning it is secure, scalable and decentralised. The jist of it is a unique approach to governance and that we have been able to create a decentralised network with hashgraph as the consensus mechanism. Further, as exact ordering is a given, all sorts of asset trading is well supported through the future DEX.
